## 3. Issues Identified

1. **Backend API Issues:**
   - Supplier endpoints are returning 500 errors

   - Fix any routing issues that may be causing the browser automation tool to redirect incorrectly

## 5. Next Steps

2. Retry frontend testing after backend issues are resolved
3. Complete end-to-end testing of the full application workflow
